# Among Us Auto Task
This is a Python script I wrote that uses basic pixel colour detection to automatically perform most tasks in The Skeld map on Among Us. It's designed to run with a 16:9 resolution on a 1080p monitor in fullscreen.

It runs whenever the space bar is pressed, which is the same key used to open tasks in-game. Sometimes it doesn't always register the key press, so I've got into the habit of pressing the space bar twice to open the task and run the script.

It was made one evening to improve my competency with Python. Not all tasks are completable by the script, but all of them are detectable. Some of the methods to complete the tasks could be improved, but they mostly work as they are. A list of the tasks and their status is below:
